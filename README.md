# pmapper
Poisson Maximum A-Posteriori algorithm in python

The name of this repository is an homage to MTF-Mapper, a slanted edge MTF measurement program written by Frans van den Bergh.

The contents are implementations of PMAP, an image restoration and superresolution algorithm developed by Joe Green, who is now a Principal Optical Engineer at JPL.  Several flavors of PMAP are implemented under a common interface.
